# -Aircraft-Tracking-Using-Computer-Vision
Aircraft tracking using OpenCV harnesses the power of this open-source computer vision library  to monitor and track aircraft in real-time. This method employs high-resolution cameras to capture  continuous video streams of air traffic, which are processed using OpenCVâ€™s robust image  processing and analysis capabilities.
